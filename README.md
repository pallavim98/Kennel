# Kennel-The-Automated-Pet-Feeder-
Do you ever get lazy feeding your pets? Sure, we love our pets, but just sometimes we wish we could make it automatic. Today we’ll make a smart automatic pet feeder using Arduino Uno! The key components of the project include an RTC module to track time and manage feeding schedule, distance sensor to monitor food level, light sensor to distinguish day/night, and RFID to identify our pet. Let’s get started!

# Hardware
1.Arduino Uno

2.ldr sensor

3.Ultrasonic distance sensor

4.RFID MFRC522 (can include buzzer)

5.Servo Motor

6.RTC DS1307
